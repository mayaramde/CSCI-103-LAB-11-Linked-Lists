# CSCI-103-LAB-11-Linked-Lists
Introduction
In this lab you will implement a double-ended queue using a doubly-linked list.
2 What you will learn
After completing this lab you should be able to:
 Implement an efficient doubly-linked list
 Understand the APIs for different kinds of lists
 Work with pointers to objects
 Dynamically allocate memory
 Write a destructor to prevent memory leaks 

Write the member functions in a file named delist.cpp. You may want to copyand-paste the API and comments from delist.h to get started. Remember to
include the header. Compile often to make sure you fix syntax errors as you go. Use
lots of diagrams to help reason about your code. 

Use valgrind to check for memory leaks (as well as other problems such as
uninitialized variables or out-of-bounds memory access)
